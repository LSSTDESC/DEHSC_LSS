\section{Theory}\label{sec:theory}
  \subsection{Projected quantities and power spectra}\label{ssec:theory.cellpk}
    \todo{cites everywhere}
    Our main observable is the projected overdensity of galaxies $\delta^i_g(\nv)$ as a function of sky position $\nv$ in a given redshift bin labelled by $i$. This is related to the 3D galaxy overdensity $\Delta_g$ through
    \begin{equation}
      \delta^i_g(\nv)=\int dz\,p^i(z)\,\Delta_g\left(t(z),\chi(z)\nv\right).
    \end{equation}
    Here $t(z)$ and $\chi(z)$ are the cosmic time and radial comoving distance as a function of redshift, and $p_i(z)$ is the redshift bin window function, given by the true redshift distribution of objects in the bin normalized to unit area.
  
    Given the small size of the sky patches covered by the HSC DR1, we will adopt the flat sky approximation for simplicity, in which case $\nv$ is a 2D vector. It is common to decompose $\delta^i_g(\nv)$ into its Fourier coefficients
    \begin{equation}
      a^i_{\bf l}\equiv \int\frac{d\theta^2}{2\pi}e^{-i{\bf l}\cdot\nv}\delta^i_g(\nv).
    \end{equation}
    The variance of the Fourier coefficients is the so-called angular power spectrum $\langle a^i_{\bf l}a^{j*}_{{\bf l}'}\rangle = C^{ij}_\ell\,\delta^{\cal D}({\bf l}-{\bf l}')$, where $\delta^{\cal D}$ is the 2D Dirac delta function. The 3D power spectrum $P_{gg}(z,{\bf k})$ is defined analogously for the 3D Fourier coefficients of $\Delta_g$. Both quantities are related to each other through:
    \begin{equation}
      C^{ij}_\ell = \int dz\,\frac{H(z)}{\chi^2(z)} p^i(z)p^j(z)\,P_{gg}\left(z,k=\frac{\ell+1/2}{\chi(z)}\right),
    \end{equation}
    where $H(z)$ is the expansion rate at redshift $z$, and we have used the so-called Limber approximation.
  
  \subsection{Magnification bias}\label{ssec:theory.mag}
    \todo{cites everywhere}
    Gravitational lensing alters the observed galaxy fluxes and distorts their observed positions. The combined effect, is a position-dependent modulation of the number density that distorts the clustering pattern.
    In the presence of this effect, the equations in the previous section get slightly modified. The projected galaxy overdensity becomes:
    \begin{equation}
      \delta^i_g(\nv)=\int dz\,\left[p^i(z)\,\Delta_g+\frac{W_\mu^i(z)}{H(z)}\nabla_\theta^2\nabla^{-2}\Delta_m\right],
    \end{equation}
    where $\Delta_m$ is the 3D matter overdensity (we have omitted the dependence on $t$ and $\chi\nv$ for brevity) and $W_\mu$ is the magnification kernel
    \begin{equation}
      W_\mu(z)=\frac{3H_0^2\Omega_M(1+z)}{2}\int_z^\infty dz'\,p^i(z)\,\left(5s(z')-2\right)\,\frac{\chi(z')-\chi(z)}{\chi(z)\chi(z')}.
    \end{equation}
    Here, $H_0\equiv H(z=0)$, $\Omega_M$ is the cosmological matter fraction, and $s$ is the logarithmic slope of the cumulative apparent magnitude distribution:
    \begin{equation}
      s\equiv\frac{\partial \log_{10}N(<m)}{\partial m}.
    \end{equation}
    The angular power spectrum is then given by:
    \begin{equation}
      C^{ij}_\ell = \int dz\,\frac{H(z)}{\chi^2(z)}\left[p^ip^j\,P_{gg}+\left(p^iW_\mu^j+p^jW_\mu^i\right)\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{Hk^2}P_{gm}+W_\mu^iW_\mu^j\left(\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{Hk^2}\right)^2P_{mm}\right],
    \end{equation}
    where $P_{mm}$ is the 3D power spectrum of matter fluctuations, $P_{gm}$ is the galaxy-matter cross-spectrum and we have omitted the dependence of all quantities on $z$ or $k=(\ell+1/2)/\chi$ for brevity.

  \subsection{Halo Occupation Distribution}\label{ssec:theory.hod}
    In order to model $P_{gg}(z,k)$ we use a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model \todo{cites everywhere}. In this halo model-based presciption we model the galaxy content of dark matter haloes as a function of halo mass. Details about HOD parametrizations can be found in \todo{cite}. In short, the galaxy power spectrum receives contributions from the so-called 1-halo and 2-halo terms:
    \begin{equation}
      P_{gg}(z,k) = P_{gg,{\rm 1h}}(z,k) + P_{gg,{\rm 2h}}(z,k),
    \end{equation}
    where
    \begin{align}
      & P_{gg,{\rm 1h}}(k)=\frac{1}{\bar{n}_g^2} \int dM\,\frac{dn}{dM} \bar{N}_c\,\left[\bar{N}_s^2u_s^2(k)+2\bar{N}_su_s^2(k)\right],\\
      & P_{gg,{\rm 2h}}(k)=\left(\frac{1}{\bar{n}_g} \int dM\,\frac{dn}{dM} \bar{N}_c\,\left[1+\bar{N}_su_s(k)\right]\right)^2\,P_{\rm lin}(k).\\
    \end{align}
    Here, $M$ represents halo mass, $dn/dM$ is the halo mass function, $\bar{N}_c(M)$ and $\bar{N}_s(M)$ are the mean number of central and satellite galaxies respectively, $u_s(k)$ is the Fourier transform of the normalized density profile of satellite galaxies, $P_{\rm lin}(k)$ is the linear matter power spectrum and $\bar{n}_g$ is the total mean galaxy density, given by
    \begin{equation}
      \bar{n}_g=\int dM\,\frac{dn}{dM}\bar{N}_c(M)\left[1+\bar{N}_s(M)\right].
    \end{equation}

    Following \todo{cite}, we parametrise the number of centrals and satellites as a function of mass as:
    \begin{align}
      &\bar{N}_c(M)=\frac{1}{2}\left[1+{\rm erf}\left(\frac{\log(M/M_{\rm min})}{\sigma_{{\rm ln}M}}\right)\right],\\
      &\bar{N}_s(M)=\Theta(M-M_0)\left(\frac{M-M_0}{M_1'}\right)^\alpha,
    \end{align}
    where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heavyside step function. Furthermore, we assume that $N_c$ follows a Bernoully distribution with probability $p=\bar{N}_c$, and that the number of satellites is Poisson-distributed with mean $\bar{N}_s$. Finally, we model the distribution of satellites to follow that of the dark matter, and therefore $u_s$ is a Navarro-Frenk-White profile, given by:
    \begin{equation}
      u_s(k|M)=\frac{\sin x\left[{\rm Si}\left((1+c)\,x\right)-{\rm Si}(x)\right]+\cos x\left[{\rm Ci}\left((1+c)x\right)-{\rm Ci}(x)\right]-\frac{\sin(cx)}{(1+c)x}}{{\bf ln}(1+c)-\frac{c}{1+c}},
    \end{equation}
    where $x=k R_\Delta/c$, $R_\Delta$ is the halo radius, $c=c(M)$ is the concentration parameter, and ${\rm Si}/{\rm Ci}$ are the sine and cosine integral functions. We define $R_\Delta$ as the radius that encloses $\Delta=200$ times the background matter density. The concentration-mass relation $c(M)$ also depends on the choice of $\Delta$, and we follow the parametrization of Duffy et al. \todo{cite}.

\section{Data}\label{sec:data}
  We use data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program first data release (HSC DR1 hereon). The release is extensively documented in \todo{cite}, and we only provide the details of the galaxy sample and associated data used for our clustering analysis. 
  
  \todo{General blurb about HSC DR1}
  
  We use a magnitude-limited sample constructed WIDE DR1 sample by imposing data cuts that are similar to those used to create the HSC shear catalog \todo{cite}. The exact cuts are summarized in Table \todo{make table}, and can be summarized as follows: besides a minimal set of quality cuts (selecting only primary detections with well-measured fluxes in all bands, removing objects near bad pixels, deblender artifacts \todo{check out the exact definitions in the schema browser once the website is up again}), we impose an overall apparent magnitude cut in the extinction-corrected band $i_{\rm corr}<24.5$. This choice was based on a study of the survey depth-completeness relation in order to select a homogeneous and complete sample of high-confidence ($>10\sigma$) detections (see Section \ref{ssec:methods.syst}). We also select only objects with significant detections ($>5\sigma$) in at least two of the 4 remaining bands ($g,\,r,\,z,\,y$), and remove all objects classified as stars by the data reduction pipeline \todo{check wording, maybe add a note about the fact that the s-g separator is binary for DR1}. The resulting sample has XXXX objects distributed across the 6 HSC DR1 fields as described in Table \todo{make table}.
  
  All objects have photometric redshift measurements from X different codes \todo{enumerate codes}. We use the best-fit redshift assigned by the {\tt ephor\_ab} method as a marker to divide the sample into 4 redshift bins containing roughly equal numbers of galaxies. A peliminary Fisher matrix study showed that the information content saturates quickly when slicing the data into finer redshift bins. The redshift bins are described in Table \todo{make table}, and the associated redshift distributions are described in Section \ref{ssec:methods.nz}.

\section{Methods}\label{sec:methods}
  The following sections describe the methods used to construct the data vector of angular power spectra and its covariance matrix used to constrain the parameters of our model.
  
  \subsection{Pixels and maps}\label{ssec:methods.pix}
    \todo{Describe pixelization and flat-sky approximation.}
  
  \subsection{Survey mask}\label{ssec:methods.mask}
    The reconstruction of the survey geometry is central in order to obtain unbiased estimates of the angular power spectrum. This information is encoded in the so-called ``survey mask'', which minimally encodes binary information about which areas of the sky should (mask$=1$) or should not (mask$=0$) be used in the analysis. The basis for our survey mask is the so-called ``bright-object mask'', provided with the HSC DR1, which flags sources that are close to bright stars (mag $<17.5$), with a magnitude-dependent exclusion radius. It is worth noting that the information about the bright object mask is encoded in the HSC DR1 at the catalog level in terms of per-object flags. We transform this information into a pixelized sky map through a multi-step process:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item We start by creating a low-resolution binary mask based on the presence of objects from the raw catalog in a given pixel. This mask has a pixel size of 0.6 arcmin. The large number density of the raw catalog  ($n\sim$\todo{calculate}) is high enough that masked pixels are unlikely to corresponds to intrinsically empty regions of the sky, but rather completely unobserved pixels.
      \item We upgrade the low-resolution binary mask to a higher resolution (0.2 arcmin), and remove all pixels containing objects flagged by the bright object mask. We then remove all disconnected, unmasked group of pixels, corresponding to spurious islands within the exclusion radius of a bright object with no sources in the catalogs.
      \item We downgrade the resulting mask back to the original resolution through an averaging procedure, producing a map quantifying the observed fraction of each pixel.
    \end{enumerate}
    It is worth noting that the resolution of the resulting mask ($0.6$ arcminutes) defines the resolution of all maps used in this analysis. After this procedure, we further mask all pixels with a $10\sigma$ depth below our magnitude limit of $i<24.5$, where the depth is estimated as described in Section \ref{ssec:methods.syst}.
    
    This defines our fiducial mask. As part of our systematics analysis (see Section \todo{reference}), we also study the effect of masking regions with significant contamination from the different observing conditions (described in Section \ref{ssec:methods.syst}) dependence of our measurements. It is worth noting that the NOMAD star catalog \todo{cite}, one of the datasets used to construct the brigh-object mask described above, is contaminated by a small fraction of bright nearby galaxies ($\sim10\%$). To study the impact of this contamination on our clustering measurements, we have also estimated the angular power spectra using a more recent version of the star mask (the so-called ``Arcturus'' mask described in \todo{cite}).
